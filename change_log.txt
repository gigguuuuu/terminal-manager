this is just a normal prototype and working on the web based gui interface using flutter and web assembly and i am not releasing the orginal version for it because this is a personal project and i want to do my own thing and things i want to improve about this is :

gui;
failed commands;
web based;
executation level on the api;
networking with more ai api's to create a model for this;
and making this on dart and flutter;
